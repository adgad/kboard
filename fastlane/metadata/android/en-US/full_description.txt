COMMANDS (New in v3)

Commands is a VIM-like system for adding keys that do special things. For example:

/WhatsApp italicise!dw,i(_$0_)
/WhatsApp bolden!dw,i(*$0*)
/WhatsApp italics!i(__),j
/Copy All!yy
/Repeat word x4!dw,4p
/rly sad!1000i(ðŸ˜¥ )

Full list:
d=delete previous character
dw=delete previous word
3dw=delete previous three words
dd=delete all
yy=copy all
y=copy selection
p=paste from clipboard
i(text)=output the content of the brackets ($0 gets replaced with the last deleted/copied content)
upper(text)=as o, but in upper case
lower(text)=as o, but lower case
j=move cursor back by a character
k=move cursor forward by a character
b=move cursor back by a word
w=move cursor forward by a word
s=trigger a send command
qq=switch to the keyboard application you have been using before (same as pressing the earth-wireframe key) after the rest of the commands has been executed.
